# Lunar Engine
#### The game engine you'll miss.

## Features
Key features of Lunar Engine include but are not limited to:

### Modularity
Any module can be removed if the developer sees it as unnecessary,
and they can replace it with a module built to their own standards with relative ease.

This is possible due to the wide use of interfaces throughout the project.
Discrete classes are used only when necessary.

### Integrated Economy Support
Lunar Engine features a built-in economy system for all genres of games.
From simple currency conversion to complex financial derivatives,
any aspect of the real-world economy can be replicated using only the first-party economy of the engine.

Of course, this can be disabled to implement your own economy.
